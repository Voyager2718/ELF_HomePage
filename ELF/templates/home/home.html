                In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their experience level and trophy count. Players level up by gaining experience points
                through donating and/or upgrading cards and completing achievements. The highest possible level is level
                thirteen. Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles - a player wins a battle by destroying more
                towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's
                King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory. There are 11 playing arenas in total (excluding
                the tutorial arena, Training Camp): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, Barbarian Bowl, P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell
                Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, and Legendary Arena, with
                each arena corresponding to a certain trophy count range.
